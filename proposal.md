# Proposal 

For the major project I will create a bullet hell/danmaku game. Sorta like a Touhou copy. The player will be able to move around the screen to avoid enemy bullets while trying to shoot and eliminate the enemy.

## Needs To Have List 

- Different screens for Start, Victory, Game Over  
- Player character that can be controlled using arrow keys.
- Player Lives   
- Should be able to detect if player character is hit by enemy bullets                  
- Player can fire Bullets to kill enemy
- Keep track of player points 
- at least 3 levels and a boss level
- Progression in difficulty for levels 
- Main Enemey for each level 
- Enemy Bullets & abilites
- sound effects

## Nice to have list 

- Player ability that can be activated when Z and C keys are pressed.
- Different Characters the player can choose.
- Different abilites. 
- Power bar
- Graze system (gives more points to the player if character is close to a bullet without actually hitting it).
- Different Difficulty Modes (Easy, Normal, Hard, Lunatic)
