# Proposal 

For the major project I will create a bullet hell/danmaku game. Sorta like a Touhou copy. The player will be able to move around the screen to avoid enemy bullets while trying to shoot and eliminate the enemy.

## Needs To Have List 

- Different screens for Start, Victory, Game Over ✓
- Player character that can be controlled using arrow keys. ✓
- Player Lives ✓
- Player Animations ✓
- Should be able to detect if player character is hit by enemy bullets ✓                 
- Player can fire Bullets to kill enemy using space button ✓
- Keep track of player points ✓
- at least 3 levels including boss level ✓
- Main Enemy for each level ✓
- Enemy Bullets & abilites ✓

## Nice to have list 


- sound effects
- scrolling backgrounds 
- Progression in difficulty ✓
- Player ability that can be activated C key pressed.
- Different Characters the player can choose.
- Graze system (gives more points to the player if character is close to a bullet without actually hitting it).
- Different Difficulty Modes (Easy, Normal, Hard)
