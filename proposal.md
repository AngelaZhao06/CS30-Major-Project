# Proposal 

For the major project I will create a Manic Shooter/danmaku game. The player will be able to move around the screen to avoid enemy bullets while trying to shoot and eliminate the enemy.

## Needs To Have List 

- Player character that can be controlled using arrow keys.
- Player Lives 
- Player Bullets
- Points system
- Enemy 
- Enemy Bullets & abilites


## Nice to have list 

- Player ability that can be activated when Z and C keys are pressed.
- Different Characters the player can choose.
- Different abilites. 
- Power bar
- Different Levels
