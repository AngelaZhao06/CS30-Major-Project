# Advice for myself if I were to do it again 
- learn how to use P5play earlier. I spent a abysmal amount of time manually doing the math for the hitboxes when I could've just used a p5play sprite function and ask if it were overlapped with anything.
- worry about animations later and get the levels done earlier 

# Hardest Part of the Project?
- Definitly the enemy bullet patterns, working with sin, cos and radians was pretty wacky.

# Did I complete the needs to have List?
yes 

# What am I most proud of? 
- Same as the Hardest part of the project. I think the bullet motion looks pretty swaggy;
